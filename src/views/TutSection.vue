        h4 Drawing Is easy
        p A glance into our first p5.js program, lets start with drawing a simple circle in code!! 
        p with program, you are like talking with a painter who act exact the same command you tell him, so, you can tell him to draw a circle with orange, just say "fill('orange')", and then, write ellipse with position and size. You get a circle!
        p There are three basic command to remember, the first one is createCanvas, which create an area for us to draw on
        pre
          | createCanvas( SIZEX , SIZEY );
        p Coding is just like talking, but with a little stricter grammar constraint. For example, to run a command you can just type background, then pass what color you want to fill in a pair of parenthesis () right after that, if the data we passing are not any of the standard command, we have to add a pair of double quote to tell the computer it is some data, not a command to run!
        pre
          | background('black');
          | fill('orange');

        h3 Draw a Point and a Line
      .col-sm-6
        codearea(v-model="code2")
      .col-sm-6
        p Shapes can break into basic units - lines and points, for each point, we need to provide the x and y position, which means how far is it away from the top of the canvas and also from the left side. 
        pre
          | point(x,y)
        p Obviously, extended from a point, when we want to draw a line, which needs two points in total, we have to pass four values, x1,y1,x2,y2 to the "line" methods in p5js
        pre
          | line (x1,x2,y1,y2)

        h4 How to draw some simple shapes?
        p There are a lot of useful shape functions in p5.js, e.g. rect, ellipse, triangle, circle, line... etc. Every shape function has it's own parameters to pass, don't panic. Whenever you need to check what you chould pass to a drawing method, visit <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">the p5.js document </a> type the command in "Search in API" box, then you will geta very detailed parameters list of what you should pass when using this command.
      
        h4 Basics of moving image
        p things in "setup" function will be excuted once since the sketch start, if we want to make animations or any movement in the sketch, which need to draw a tons of new image as the time progressing, we will have to put our drawing codes into the drawing function. Then it will be run again and again for about 30 times a second! It's like the clock-erasing artwork in the airport, or you can think it like stop motion animations- which is made by lots of frames play in a high speed which made an illusion of continuous animation.
        pre
          | function setup(){
          |   // things will run once 
          | }
        pre
          | function draw(){
          |   // things will run 30 times a second 
          | }

        h3 Colorify! fill and stroke
      .col-sm-6
        codearea(v-model="code4")
      .col-sm-6
        p When we are drawing shapes, there are two component that we can modify - stroke and the fill color. In p5.js, we excute the codes line-by-line, which means if we want to have a red circle, we set the fill to red first - which is the default color of the next shape we draw. Then we draw the circle. the color will remain effecting the shapes we draw in the following lines till we change it by fill function again.
        p There're also some useful keyword that can get specific data in p5.js directly, e.g. if we want to get the width of the canvas, we can simple type width, so does the height. To extend, drawing a circle in the middle of the canvas is no longer hard to caculate something like 1000/2 by ourself, but width/2 will caculate the center point what ever size we specified when we initialized the canvas.
        pre
          | fill("red")
          | ellipse(50,50,60,60)
          | ellipse(width/2,height/2,60,60)
        p Mouse positions can get by also variales - mouseX and mouseY
        pre
          | ellipse(mouseX,mouseY,60,60)
        p The magic of coding is not just like this, if you map the mouseX to one of the component of a <b>color(r,g,b)</b>, you can get a color-changing circle based on the position your mouse at!
        pre
          | fill("red")
          | ellipse(mouseX,255,255);
        p Try - what will happen if you use mouseX as the radius of the ellipse? Practice in the left side and play with the code by yourself!
